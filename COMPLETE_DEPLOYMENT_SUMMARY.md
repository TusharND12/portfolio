## 🎯 If Images Aren't Showing

This is usually **browser caching**. Solution:

### Method 1: Hard Refresh
- Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Method 2: Incognito Mode
- Open incognito/private window
- Visit: https://tusharnd12.github.io/portfolio/

### Method 3: Clear Cache
1. `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Check "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Reload page

### Method 4: Wait
- CDN can take 5-10 minutes to propagate
- Be patient!

## ⚠️ What Doesn't Work (Expected)

Since GitHub Pages is static hosting:

### ❌ Backend Features
- Contact form submission (needs `/api/contact`)
- Chat API (needs `/api/chat`)
- Email service (needs server)
- Analytics tracking (needs `/api/analytics`)
- Achievement tracking (needs `/api/achievements`)

### 💡 Solutions for Backend
**Option 1: Use Third-Party Services**
- Contact Form: [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) or [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
- Chat: [Typeform](https://typeform.com/) or [Crisp](https://crisp.chat/)
- Analytics: [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) or Google Analytics

**Option 2: Deploy to Vercel**
- Full Next.js support
- API routes work
- Serverless functions
- Easy deployment
- Free tier
- Visit: https://vercel.com

**Option 3: Keep GitHub Pages**
- Frontend works perfectly
- All visual features
- No server costs
- Just use external services for forms
