# 🔧 Fix GitHub Pages Deployment

The site is showing the README instead of your portfolio. This means GitHub Pages isn't using the built site.

## 🎯 Quick Fix

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Actions Deployment
1. Go to: https://github.com/TusharND12/portfolio/settings/pages
2. Under **Source**, change from "Deploy from a branch" to **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click anywhere to auto-save

### Step 2: Trigger the Workflow
The workflow should run automatically. If not:
1. Go to: https://github.com/TusharND12/portfolio/actions
2. Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select "main" branch
5. Click "Run workflow" again

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
Monitor at: https://github.com/TusharND12/portfolio/actions
- Yellow = building ⏳
- Green = success ✅
- Takes 2-5 minutes

## ✅ What Should Happen

After deployment succeeds, visit:
**https://tusharnd12.github.io/portfolio/**

You should see your beautiful portfolio with:
- Navigation bar
- Hero section
- All your content
- 3D graphics
- Animations

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Check Actions Logs:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click the latest workflow run
3. Click on "build" job
4. Check for errors in the logs

### Common Issues:

**Error: "path ./out not found"**
- Means static export didn't work
- Check next.config.mjs has `output: 'export'` when GITHUB_PAGES is true
- ✅ Already configured!

**Error: Build failed**
- Check dependencies in package.json
- ✅ All fixed!

**Still showing README**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Try incognito mode
- Wait 5 more minutes

## 🎯 Right Now:

Go here and change the dropdown:
**https://github.com/TusharND12/portfolio/settings/pages**

Change "Source" to **"GitHub Actions"**

That's the fix! 🚀
