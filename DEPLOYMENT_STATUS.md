## 🚀 How to Enable GitHub Pages

I just opened your GitHub Pages settings in your browser.

### You should see:
1. A page with "Pages" settings
2. A section called "Source" with a dropdown
3. The dropdown probably says "Deploy from a branch"

### Your Action:
1. **Click the dropdown** that says "Deploy from a branch"
2. **Select** "GitHub Actions" from the list
3. **Done!** It auto-saves

### What Happens Next:
- ✅ GitHub triggers deployment automatically
- ⏳ Build takes 2-5 minutes
- 🚀 Site goes live at: **https://tusharnd12.github.io/portfolio/**
