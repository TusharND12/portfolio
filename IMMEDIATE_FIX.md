# 🚨 IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED

## Your site is showing the README because:
❌ GitHub Pages source is set to **"Deploy from a branch"**  
✅ Should be **"GitHub Actions"**

## 🎯 ONE CLICK FIX:

### Right Now:
1. I opened your GitHub Pages settings
2. You should see a dropdown that says "Deploy from a branch"
3. **Change it to "GitHub Actions"**
4. Click anywhere to save

### Then:
- GitHub will automatically build your portfolio
- Takes 2-5 minutes
- You'll see it building in Actions tab
- Then your site works! ✅

## 📍 After Fix:

Your portfolio will work at:
**https://tusharnd12.github.io/portfolio/**

All your content will load properly:
- Navigation ✅
- Hero section ✅
- Projects ✅
- 3D graphics ✅
- Everything! ✅

---

**You should see the settings page open now. Change that dropdown!** 🎯
