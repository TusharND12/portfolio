## 🎯 Final Steps to Deploy:

### 1. Check GitHub Actions
Go to: **https://github.com/TusharND12/portfolio/actions**

Look for the latest workflow run. It should be building now or just finished.

### 2. If Workflow is Running:
- Wait for it to complete (green checkmark ✅)
- Takes 2-5 minutes

### 3. If Workflow Shows Error:
Click on the workflow → Click on "build" job → Check error messages

### 4. Verify GitHub Pages Settings:
Go to: **https://github.com/TusharND12/portfolio/settings/pages**

Make sure:
- **Source**: GitHub Actions ✅
- **Custom domain**: (empty) ✅

### 5. Test Your Site:
Wait 5 minutes after deployment completes, then visit:
**https://tusharnd12.github.io/portfolio/**

## 🆘 If Still Not Working:

### Option A: Manually Trigger Deployment
1. Go to Actions
2. Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Click "Run workflow" again
5. Wait for it to complete

### Option B: Check Build Logs
1. Actions → Latest run → Build job
2. Look for errors
3. Tell me what the error says

### Option C: Use Alternative Deployment
Consider deploying to **Vercel** instead:
