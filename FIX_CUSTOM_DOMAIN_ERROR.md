# 🔧 Fix Custom Domain Error

The error: **"The custom domain 'portfolio' is not properly formatted"**

This means GitHub is trying to use "portfolio" as a custom domain instead of understanding it's just the repository name.

## ✅ Solution

### Step 1: Remove Custom Domain
1. Go to: https://github.com/TusharND12/portfolio/settings/pages
2. Scroll to **"Custom domain"** section
3. If there's ANYTHING in the Custom domain field:
   - **Clear it completely**
   - Click **Save**

### Step 2: Check Source is GitHub Actions
1. In the same settings page, check **"Source"** dropdown
2. Make sure it says: **"GitHub Actions"**
3. If not, change it to **"GitHub Actions"**

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- GitHub will automatically rebuild
- Check Actions tab: https://github.com/TusharND12/portfolio/actions
- Wait for green checkmark ✅

### Step 4: Test Your Site
Visit: **https://tusharnd12.github.io/portfolio/**

## 🎯 What Should Be Configured

### In GitHub Pages Settings:
```
Source: GitHub Actions ✅
Custom domain: (empty) ✅
Enforce HTTPS: checked ✅
```

### NOT:
```
Custom domain: portfolio ❌
Custom domain: portfolio.github.io ❌
```

## 📝 Understanding the URLs

Your portfolio URLs:
- **Repository**: https://github.com/TusharND12/portfolio
- **Live Site**: https://tusharnd12.github.io/portfolio/

The `/portfolio` part comes from the repository NAME, not a custom domain.

## 🎯 Action Needed

Right now, go to settings and **clear any custom domain** field!

👉 **https://github.com/TusharND12/portfolio/settings/pages**

Then save and your site should work! 🚀
